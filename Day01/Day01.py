#   *A system prompt that tells them what task they are performing and what tone they should use
#   *A user prompt -- the conversation starter that they should reply to

# The system prompt is a special message that tells the model what to do.

# Define our system prompt - you can experiment with this later, changing the last sentence to 'Respond in markdown in Spanish."

# - **Repositories**: A whopping **31 repositories** to choose from! Itâ€™s like a candy store... if all the candy was slightly stale and just okay. Some highlights include:
#   - **ASP.NET Core Web App**: Because nothing screams originality like a CRUD app.
#   - **Book to Audio Converter**: Who needs to read anyway?
#   - **Django REST API**: Because every dev needs a REST API in their life.

# - **Achievements**: It looks like he has four followers. Wow, such popularity in the vast ocean of GitHub!

# - **Contact Information**: Just in case visiting his GitHub wasnâ€™t intrusive enough, you can also email him. What a generous offer!
