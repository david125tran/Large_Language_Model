# Large_Language_Model  
**Day01** - Use the [OpenAI API Platform's](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) cloud-based API to automate interaction with language models (Frontier, 'gpt-4o-mini') for two main purposes: basic chat and summarizing content from a scraped website.  
**Day02** - Enabling local execution of an AI model (LLaMA) through the Ollama API  
**Day05** - Using BeautifulSoup to scrape URLs from my GitHub.  Then using OpenAI's ['gpt-4o-mini'](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini) API platform to find relevant links to create a portfolio showcasing my projects in markdown.  The markdown file was generated by AI thru the API call.  
**Day06** - Connecting to different LLM platforms.  Then configuring Open AI's 'GPT-4o' and Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash models to adopt contrasting personas to talk to one another.  GPT's stateless nature requires me to maintain the conversation history while I am able to leverage Gemini's persistent chat capability.  The script then runs a defined number of conversation turns and the dialog is then saved to an HTML file for easier viewing.  I configure GPT to be a gullable child and Gemini to be a teacher that loves telling elaborate lies involving Dragons and Unicorns.  You can look at paste the HTML contents to an ['HTML Viewer'](https://html.onlineviewer.net/)
