# Large_Language_Model  
  
This repo is me coding along with an online course on LLM.  But I diverge from the material and put my own spin on the course instruction.  
  
**Day01** - Use the [OpenAI API Platform's](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) cloud-based API to automate interaction with language models (Frontier, 'gpt-4o-mini') for two main purposes: basic chat and summarizing content from a scraped website.  
**Day02** - Enabling local execution of an AI model (LLaMA) through the Ollama API  
**Day05** - Using BeautifulSoup to scrape URLs from my GitHub.  Then using OpenAI's ['gpt-4o-mini'](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini) API platform to find relevant links to create a portfolio showcasing my projects in markdown.  The markdown file was generated by AI thru the API call.  
**Day06** - Connecting to different LLM platforms.  Then configuring Open AI's 'GPT-4o' and Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash models to adopt contrasting personas to talk to one another.  GPT's stateless nature requires me to maintain the conversation history while I am able to leverage Gemini's persistent chat capability.  The script then runs a defined number of conversation turns and the dialog is then saved to an HTML file for easier viewing.  I configure GPT to be a gullable child and Gemini to be a teacher that loves telling elaborate lies involving Dragons and Unicorns.  You can paste the HTML contents to an [Online HTML Viewer](https://html.onlineviewer.net/) to render the HTML for easier viewing.  
**Day07** - Creating a simple web app with the Gradio package.  The app is configured to receive a user input for how they want to edit a photo using OpenAI's 'dall-e-2' model.  The image is then passed to the model for it to be edited by AI.

**Day08** - Creating an AI Chatbot, maintaining context between messages, & configuring it as a Shiny App.  This website (chatbot) acts as an "AI Art Idea Generator Assistant" that helps you come up with creative ideas for images featuring your pets. You can chat with it to get suggestions on different art styles, colors, and themes for AI-generated pictures.  
Example:

I then put this idea (from my chatbot) into a ChatGPT for image generation:

And then I get a cool photo with some cats!
